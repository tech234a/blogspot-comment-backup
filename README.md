### Running this worker:
You can run this worker by running `python3 worker.py` from the `src` directory of this project. Python 3.7.2 is recommended and the `aiohttp` and `tldextract` modules are required. (You can install `aiohttp` and `tldextract` by running `pip install aiohttp tldextract`.)

This worker also runs on Heroku. To deploy to Heroku, follow these steps:
- Fork this repo
- Install the [pull](https://github.com/apps/pull) app to your fork for automatic worker updates as needed
- [Create a new app](https://dashboard.heroku.com/new-app) on Heroku
- Go to the *Deploy* tab on your Heroku app and link your GitHub repo fork. Enable automatic deploys.
- Go to the *Resources* tab on your Heroku app and ensure the *worker* dyno is enabled. (You may need to refresh the page to see the *worker* dyno option.
